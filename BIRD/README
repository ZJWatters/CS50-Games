    A mobile game by Dong Nguyen that went viral in 2013, utilizing a very simple 
    but effective gameplay mechanic of avoiding pipes indefinitely by just tapping 
    the screen, making the player's bird avatar flap its wings and move upwards slightly.

    Assignment was to make the gaps between pipes slighlty random,
    make the distant between pipe pairs slightly random, 
    award medals based on the players score (gold = 30, silver = 20, bronze = 10),
    and to implment the pause feature. 
    
    Controls:
    jump = spacebar
    pause = p
    quit = escape
